# Assignment 2

Write a Python program that manages a grocery list. This program will utilize both lists and tuples.

## Requirements

1. Initialize a list of 5 grocery items (e.g., ["apple", "banana", "milk", "bread", "eggs"]).
2. Print the entire grocery list.
3. Add a new item to the list from user input.
4. Remove an item from the grocery list by its name.
5. Sort the list in alphabetical order and print the updated list.
6. Ask to finalize the list and make it immutable upon confirmation.

## Example Expected Output

```
Initial Grocery List: ['apple', 'banana', 'milk', 'bread', 'eggs']
Enter item to add: cheese
Enter item to remove: bread
Updated Grocery List: ['apple', 'banana', 'cheese', 'eggs', 'milk']
Finalize List? (y/n): y
Final Output: ('apple', 'banana', 'cheese', 'eggs', 'milk')
```
