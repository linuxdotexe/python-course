# Assignment - 1

Write a Python program that calculates the area of different shapes based on user input.

The program should:

1. Prompt the user to select the type of shape they want to calculate the area for:
    - Circle
    - Rectangle
    - Square
2. Based on the user's selection, the program should ask for the required dimensions:
    - For a **Circle**, ask for the radius.
    - For a **Rectangle**, ask for the length and breadth.
    - For a **Square**, ask for the side length.
3. The program should then calculate and print the area of the chosen shape.

## Example Output:

```
Enter the number for the object you wish to get the area of:
1. Circle
2. Rectangle
3. Square

Enter your response: 1
Enter radius of the circle: 5
Area: 78.5
```

Make sure your program handles all three cases correctly and uses functions to calculate and display the area.
